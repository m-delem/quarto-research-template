The lab notebook is the main place to design the code, try things iteratively 
and not worry too much about the final output. It will not be rendered upon 
running `quarto render` in the terminal, because the file name begins with an
underscore.

*Workflow:*
- Write code and explore the data in the lab notebook.
- When something is functional, reproducible and ready to be included in the
  main pipeline, remodel it into a function.
- Transfer said function inside a standalone R script in the R/ folder.
- These functions will be run successively in the final analysis and reports.
